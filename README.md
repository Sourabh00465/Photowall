# Photowall
A simple single‑page PhotoWall web app built with React for the UI, Redux for predictable state management, and Firebase as the backend database. Users can add, view, comment on, and remove photos; data is persisted in Firebase and synchronized with the Redux store for a responsive, real‑time experience.
